1) Initially prepare the test and training data to csv files as provided in this folder
2) For the first part(fully feed forward neural network) of this experiment-
   a) Run nn_test1.py file and it will output the results for the best model, the best model with tanh function and the best model for ReLU and mean square error as loss function along with the results for other models with different hyperparameters
3) For the second part(convolutional neural network) of this experiment-
   a) Run cnn.py to get the results for the best learned model
   b) Edit the code at the places mentioned using comments to obtain the results for the models with other parameters
